# WarFriends-Builds
Builds for our WarFriends Game

Here you can get the latest build of our game and test it.

The game consist in a desktop part, where you can see your player, and a mobile part, which act as a controller.

You will need the desktop (or notebook) version,  and, also, the mobile version. 

### Details about the game:
You need at least one more person (with a mobile device) to play with you.

To start the game, you should open the desktop version of the game and press "Start Server" in the top left corner. 

Then, you have to find your local ip (http://www.mon-ip.com/adresse-ip-locale.php). 

You need to connect your mobile devices to the same wi-fi network as the desktop.

Open the mobile application and enter the local ip of the server. Write a name for your player, and tap connect.

In case of successful connection, your player will spawn at the top (on the central desktop).

Now, you can control him with your mobile.
